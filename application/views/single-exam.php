            <li>Marks obtained in Paper 1 and Paper 2 will be taken while the rank is calculated by the concerned authorities. The example is mentioned below:</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Marks obtained in Physics = Marks obtained in Paper 1 (Physics) + Marks obtained in Paper 2 (Physics)</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Similar method will be used for calculating total marks for Mathematics and Chemistry.</li>
            <li>The aggregate marks for JEE Advanced 2020&nbsp;will be calculated using the following formula:</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Aggregate Marks/Scores obtained in JEE Advanced = Aggregate marks in (Physics + Mathematics + Chemistry)</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>The rank list of JEE Advanced 2020&nbsp;will be prepared based on the aggregate marks obtained by the candidates in the entrance examination.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Only candidates who score the minimum prescribed marks in each subject and in aggregate will be included in the rank list.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>JEE Advanced Tie Breaker Policy</h3>
            <p>If there is a clash between two or more candidates in terms of their aggregate marks, then the following tie resolving policy shall be used:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Aspirants with higher positive ranks will be given a higher rank.</li>
            <li>Aspirants with greater marks in mathematics will be given a higher rank.</li>
            <li>Aspirants with greater marks in Physics will be given a higher rank.</li>
            <li>If the tie situation still continues, then it will be resolved by assigning the same ranks to the candidates.&nbsp;</li>
